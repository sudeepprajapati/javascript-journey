Understanding .txt vs .js Files

A .txt file is a plain text file, while a .js file is a JavaScript file.

You can technically write console.log(12) in both .txt and .js files.

However, in a .js file, console.log(12) has special meaning: it is valid JavaScript syntax that will execute in a JavaScript runtime.

The key difference is that .js files can be interpreted or compiled by software environments that understand JavaScript syntax, while .txt files are just raw text with no execution context.

How Code is Understood and Executed

Programming languages require compilers or interpreters—software that understands the language's syntax and semantics.

These tools extract meaning from the code and translate or execute it.

JavaScript Runtime History

In the early days, JavaScript could only run inside web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Each browser had its own embedded JavaScript engine (e.g., Chrome has V8, Firefox has SpiderMonkey).

JavaScript was originally used only for frontend (client-side) development.

Evolution to Backend: Node.js and Beyond

Eventually, developers extracted the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8) from browsers.

This led to the creation of standalone JavaScript runtimes like:

Node.js – Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

Deno – Also created by Ryan Dahl as a modern reimagining of Node.js.

These runtimes allow JavaScript to be executed outside the browser, enabling backend (server-side) development.

Popular JavaScript Environments

Node.js

Most widely used JavaScript runtime.

Enables building backend servers, APIs, command-line tools, etc.

Has a massive ecosystem (npm) for libraries and tools.

Deno

A newer runtime from the same creator as Node.js.

Designed with security, simplicity, and modern standards in mind.

Uses ES modules by default, includes TypeScript support out of the box.

Writing and Running JavaScript Code

You can write JavaScript code using editors like VS Code.

After writing .js files, you can execute them using runtimes like Node.js:

bash
Copy code
node filename.js
Summary

.txt files are plain text, while .js files are executable scripts in JavaScript.

JavaScript began as a browser language but evolved to support backend development through Node.js and Deno.

These environments provide the necessary tools to interpret and run JavaScript code outside of the browser.
